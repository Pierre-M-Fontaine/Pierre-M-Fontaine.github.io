    <p style="font-size:28px;">About Me:</p>
    <p style="font-size:18px;">I am a creative and curious person who is always learning new processes, improving on old techniques and looking out for new trends in both design and technology.</p>
    <p style="font-size:18px;">My talents include 2D and 3D illustration and animation, modelling, paper crafting, graphic design, photo retouching, and 3D printing.</p>
    <p style="font-size:18px;">I studied 2D animation in college and spent the first 20 years of my professional career working both full-time and freelance for various animation companies. Seven of those years were spent at Music Pen, Inc, a leading multi-media company as a senior artist and animation supervisor working on projects for Microsoft and Paramount Interactive.</p>
    <p style="font-size:18px;">I’ve spent the last 20 years at Amscan, Inc, as a product and packaging designer. My responsibilities include creating conceptual sketches, final mechanicals and mold drawings. I have used my CAD and 3D software skills to review CAD files created by outside vendors and create final renderings for catalog and demonstration purposes. I’ve introduced 3D printing technology to the company which facilitates the approval process for plastic and paper plates and other molded items.</p>
    <p style="font-size:18px;">I strive to make workflows more efficient by reflecting on processes and strategies from past projects. I am always trying to improve my skills, develop new ways of working, and share my knowledge with others.</p>
